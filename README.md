# Monkey Language Interpreter in V

Completed [Monkey Programming Language](https://monkeylang.org/) in [V](https://github.com/vlang/v) from the [Interpreter Book by Thorsten Ball](https://interpreterbook.com)

## Thoughts
This was one of the best books I had read. After all this time programming, finally getting to see the thought processes behind making a language was incredibly enlightening. Every decision in the language takes a lot of effort to actually make happen. Though thatâ€™s not even my favorite part of the book, the thing I like the most about it is how much it really pushes your â€˜host languageâ€™ as the book puts it to the test. The interpreter has some pretty complex implementations that really make you find out more about the language you use to write it. I also got to see why I loved V so much while building this.

Ever since I found out about V, I fell in love! It had all the syntax my dream programming language would have. It was so easy to fly through scripts I wanted to make and it had so many things in the standard lib, while still being fast. I was and am sure this is gonna be a huge language once it reaches 1.0. 

At first I was scared to write the interpreter in V. I worried that since it hadnâ€™t yet reached 1.0 that there would be some impossible bug that would stop me from finishing. But given how welcoming and responsive the [discord](https://discord.gg/vlang) was/is I was pretty sure that they would help me out. I had seen someone attempted it 4 years ago and dropped it at the beginning of the parser chapter. That made me a bit nervous, but I said whatever it mustâ€™ve changed a lot since then and decided Iâ€™ll give it a shot and see what happens. 

Throughout the process of building this, it made me really familiar with all the amazing features of V and all the great decisions the creator and team made. Every small detail from options, testing, easy string interpolation, easy multi-line strings, sum types, error handling, default immutability, the â€˜orâ€™ operator (my favorite) and the heap attribute are so cool that it made it so fun to do this! I could rant on about why I love each of the features, but I implore new V users to try and see for yourself. 

I had finally got to the end and I was so happy because it showed me V definitely has the stuff to make really intricate programs. And that V is definitely its own thing, its not just Go or C or Rust or Swift, but takes the best of so many things and puts in all in one place! Even when I had the one bug that was stopping me from moving on, they had fixed the issue the same day (thanks to Felipe and spy)! (My example code was even added as a test which was pretty cool!) The guys on the V dev team are so nice and helpful, such a cool community from what Iâ€™ve seen.

This project really made me appreciate how hard language designers worked to make their vision and how much I love the vision that the creator of V (Alex) and the team have for V! V stays so simple to use and learn and get started with after all this time. No worrying about the GIL, or async traits or undefined or writing 100 lines for a simple functionality, just code. So beautiful!

## Next Steps
Maybe go through the compiler book or the lost chapter ðŸ™ˆ
